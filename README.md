# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

This project is the challenge for week 19th of the Data Science Bootcamp. It allows us to put into practice and showcase the skills learned in Module 19 of the bootcamp.

### Purpose

During this project, we created a binary classifier capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

Program files related to this project can be found in the `Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis` repository.

### Data Preprocessing

#### - Target Variables

#### - Features

#### - Variables removed from dataset

### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model

#### - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

#### - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

#### - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
